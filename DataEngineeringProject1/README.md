# INTRODUCTION
<br>Data from Alcohol Inventory was used to load data from .csv files to SQL Server
<br>***Pandas***, which is a Python library, was used to clean and transform .csv file.<br> ***Pyodbc***, which is a Python module that is used to access to ODBC databases, was used to gain access to SQL Server, create a database, then design tables and load data from csv files to these tables

# MAIN CONCLUSIONS
<br> All steps were successfully done. <br>Thanks to **a pyodbc module**, it is possible to gain access to SQL Server and create a database, design tables and execute a SQL statement.
