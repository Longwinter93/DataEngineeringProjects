# DataEngineeringProjects
**DataEngineeringProjects Repository** consists of four projects that are related to Data Engineering projects.

## [DataEngineeringProject1](https://github.com/Longwinter93/DataEngineeringProjects/tree/main/DataEngineeringProject1)
<br />CSV files were read into DataFrames by using **Pandas**. Then, DataFrames were loaded to **SQL Server** by using Python.
<br />In this project these technologies were used:
- _Python (Pandas, pyodbc)_
- _SQL Server_

## [DataEngineeringProject2](https://github.com/Longwinter93/DataEngineeringProjects/tree/main/DataEngineeringProject2)
<br />It is a IoT Smoke Detection project where data was emitted at high volumne in a continuous, incremental manner with the goal of low-latency processing. Data was transformed by **Apache Spark** and then loaded to **SQL Server**.
<br />In this project these technologies were used:
- _Python (Pandas)_
- _Apache Kafka_
- _Apache Spark_
- _SQL Server_

## [DataEngineeringProject3](https://github.com/Longwinter93/DataEngineeringProjects/tree/main/DataEngineeringProject3)
<br />Data was extracted from websites that holds Currency Exchange Rates for Currencies.
<br />Data was continously generated. Data was consumed by **Apache Kafka**. These tasks were triggered by **Apache Airflow**
<br />Data from **Apache Kafka** was read as well as transformed by **Apache Spark**.
<br />Finally, data was loaded to **PostgresSQL**. 
<br />**Docker** was used to run this application in multicontainers.
<br />In this project these technologies were used:
- _Python_
- _Apache Airflow_
- _Apache Kafka_
- _Apache Spark_
- _PostgreSQL_
- _Docker_

## [DataEngineeringProject4](https://github.com/Longwinter93/DataEngineeringProjects/tree/main/DataEngineeringProject4)
<br />US Dollar Exchange Rates Table as well as Percentage Change in the Last 24 Hours Tables were extracted from a website. Data was extracted and loaded to a **MinIO** bucket using **Python**.
<br />This data was also continously generated. Data was consumed by **Apache Kafka**. These tasks were triggered by **Apache Airflow**
<br />Data from **Apache Kafka** was read as well as transformed by **Apache Spark**.
<br />Finally, data was loaded to **Apache Cassandra**. 
<br />**Docker** was used to run this application in multicontainers.
<br />In this project these technologies were used:
- _Python_
- _Apache Airflow_
- _MinIO_
- _Apache Kafka_
- _Apache Spark_
- _Apache Cassandra_
- _Docker_
